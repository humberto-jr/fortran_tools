About
-----

A collection of useful standalone routines and modules (some from third parties) for
Fortran projects.



How to use
----------

Use one of the shell scripts in the `scripts/` directory to compile all routines
(either GNU `gfortran` or Intel `ifort`). Then, link the object files `.o` (and `.mod`
for modules) to your project.
